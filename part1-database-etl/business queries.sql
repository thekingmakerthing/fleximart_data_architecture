SELECT 
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS customer_name,
    c.email,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM 
    customers c
    INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) >= 2

    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold,
    SUM(oi.subtotal) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    products p
    INNER JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
